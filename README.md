# RandomDiceGame

The game rules are: one die is rolled,
  the user can roll as many more times as they like and accumulate the 
  points (dollars).  They can stop at any time they want and leave 
  with that total, but if they roll a die that matches the first one rolled, 
   they lose all their total and leave the game.
